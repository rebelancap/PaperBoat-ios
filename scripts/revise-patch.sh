# WHY THIS EXISTS (inherited from the siblings). Doing this by hand —
# `patch -R ... 2>/dev/null` in a loop — silently swallowed a failed reverse
# three times in one session on Lighthouse. Each time the generator then ran
# against a PARTIALLY PATCHED tree and wrote a patch whose context encoded
# another patch's edits. That is invisible until overlay-drill.sh's step 3
# catches it, or until a clean checkout fails to build. The reverse must be
# LOUD (program ground rule 3).
